But its circulation was\r\nconfined almost exclusively to the lower orders of society: he\r\nwas not aware, at the time of its compilation, that our young men\r\nof fashion would at no very distant period be as distinguished\r\nfor the vulgarity of their jargon as the inhabitants of Newgate;\r\nand he therefore conceived it superfluous to incorporate with his\r\nwork the few examples of fashionable slang that might occur to\r\nhis observation.", 'But our Jehus of rank have a phraseology not less peculiar to\r\nthemselves, than the disciples of Barrington: for the uninitiated\r\nto understand their modes of expression, is as impossible as for\r\na Buxton to construe the Greek Testament. To sport an Upper\r\nBenjamin, and to swear with a good grace, are qualifications\r\neasily attainable by their cockney imitators; but without the aid\r\nof our additional definitions, neither the cits of Fish-street,\r\nnor the boors of Brentford would be able to attain the language\r\nof whippism. We trust, therefore, that the whole tribe of\r\nsecond-rate Bang Ups, will feel grateful for our endeavour to render\r\nthis part of the work as complete as possible. By an occasional\r\nreference to our pages, they may be initiated into all the\r\npeculiarities of language by which the man of spirit is\r\ndistinguished from the man of worth. They may now talk bawdy\r\nbefore their papas, without the fear of detection, and abuse\r\ntheir less spirited companions, who prefer a good dinner at home\r\nto a glorious UP-SHOT in the highway, without the hazard of a\r\ncudgelling.', 'But we claim not merely the praise of gratifying curiosity, or\r\naffording assistance to the ambitious; we are very sure that the\r\nmoral influence of the Lexicon Balatronicum will be more certain\r\nand extensive than that of any methodist sermon that has ever\r\nbeen delivered within the bills of mortality. We need not descant\r\non the dangerous impressions that are made on the female mind, by\r\nthe remarks that fall incidentally from the lips of the brothers\r\nor servants of a family; and we have before observed, that\r\nimproper topics can with our assistance be discussed, even before\r\nthe ladies, without raising a blush on the cheek of modesty. It\r\nis impossible that a female should understand the meaning of\r\nTWIDDLE DIDDLES, or rise from table at the mention of BUCKINGER\'S\r\nBOOT. Besides, Pope assures us, that "VICE TO BE HATED NEEDS BUT\r\nTO BE SEEN;" in this volume it cannot be denied, that she is seen\r\nvery plainly; and a love of virtue is, therefore, the necessary\r\nresult of perusing it.', 'The propriety of introducing the UNIVERSITY SLANG will be readily\r\nadmitted; it is not less curious than that of the College in the\r\nOld\r\nBailey, and is less generally understood. When the number and\r\naccuracy of our additions are compared with the price of the\r\nvolume, we have no doubt that its editors will meet with the\r\nencouragement that is due to learning, modesty, and virtue.', 'ABBESS, or LADY ABBESS, A bawd, the mistress of a\r\n  brothel.', 'ABEL-WACKETS.
